volume = {11},
number = {3},
pages = {R25},
annote = {* most methods use total read counts.
* some methods alter the distribution, thus count based methods can not be applied.

* assumption of library size scaling: sequencing a sample to half the depth results approximately in half of the reads per gene.
* not always true! bias towards highly abundant genes, especially if they are also long, since these are most likely sequenced.
* reads of a gene depend on the expression of the gene, the length but also on the expression properties of the whole sample (see example in text).

* TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) estimates scale estimators on trimmed means of M-values between samples. trimming removes by default 30% of high and low (?) M-values.

my summary: reference for "library size normalization is biased". if I got it right someing like this is also implemented in DEseq.}

* Most regulation is excerted at the translation initiation.
* RNA structures that impede the 40S subunit to bind/interact with the 5' end affect translational efficiency.
* miRNAs generally bind in 3' UTR and recruit eIF-inhibitory factors.
* in vitro findings show that miRNAs affect cap-dependent, but not IRES mediated translation. Thus they most likely repress translation initiation.}

* Almost half of the genes are expressed across all tissues.
* 30% of proteins targeted by clinically approved drugs are expressed in all tissues.
* Tissues with the highest number of tissue enhanced/enriched genes are testis and brain.
* Claim that only house keeping genes are expressed in both organs and cell lines of the same tissue, but not tissue enhanced genes. This could however also reflect a comparison between a single cell type (cell line) and a mixture of cells (organ). -> check m{\&}m! Otherwise, that's a important point! According to the procedure it is well possible that the organ tissue sample could be a mixture of different cell types, but contamination should not be too high (tissue slice evaluated by a pathologist). Question however also is how well the homogenizer was cleaned!

* MICROARRAY NORMALIZATION ASSUMPTION MAY NOT BE VALID!
* Limitation: they don't know where the miRNA bound, only to which gene it bound (don't know even the transcript variant!). Binding site was identified in silico.
* In line with the literature they found that about 40-50% of mRNAs had a miRNA site with a seed region.
* Questionable how much the biotin interferes the miRNA mRNA binding.

LIMITATIONS:
* Approach does not identify the true binding site, only the gene that was bound by the miRNA.
* Normalization might be an issue.

+ !!! DESeq2 performs auromatic, independent, pre-filtering by excluding genes with average counts across all samples lower than a threshold. Threshold is defined to yield the highest  number of significant genes at a certain threshold!
+ Nice explanation why a minimum effect size (sort of M-value cut off) should be used for differential expression, and not simply the test against the null of an LFC of 0.
+ !!! Wether the automatic outlier removal is always appropriate is not so clear... this should be evaluated in a per experiment basis!!!

* good paper, but not without stuff to reconsider and evaluete whether it is applicable to each experiment.}

comparison of samples after 40min of egf treatment and before treatment.

rankprod to identify de genes for transcriptome and translatome samples.
coupled: significant de in both sets.
uncoupled: anything else.
... a little black-white while there is a lot of grey in between...
well, scatterplot of m-values also shows these differences.

could that be explained by kinetiks? 40min pretty fast for transcription, maybe changes on polysomes are explained by the much faster shift of mrna from p-bodies to ribosomes.

different rna extraction protocols? trizol for transcriptional rna, phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation.
-> compare 0h samples transcr vs polysome!

Bias lower for oligo dT priming, but also present, most likely due to DNAse I fragmentation.
